#### we are using face-detection model named RetinaFace that was trained using Widerface dataset for face detection, basically taking a frame from camera and turning it into matrices that stored within db folder inside of Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing folder.



- You can read more about RetinaFace in this Repo

## Installation

### - this project was mainly built on linux, so i think there will be some error while users trying to run on windows because some difference between OS system's command such as

### on Ubuntu Linux and 

```
system("clear")
```

### on Windows Operating System

```
os.system("cls")
```


### Please notice that i hope the reader will edit some source code first then read them thoroughly and adjust to their platform


## General Installation Guide

### - Consider using python venv before jumping right in, start the installation by running this on your command line


## Windows

```
pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
```

## Linux

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



#### this project was forked from face-attendance-system and was improved with parallel programming and additional file handling for more speed and efficiency, see documentation down below to learn more about the original repo.
